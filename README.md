## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow the steps below to set it up on your local machine.

### Setup Firebase

1. Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
2. Create a new project (e.g., `techozon-blog-platform`).
3. Navigate to the **Firestore Database** section and create a new database.
4. Set up your database rules to allow read/write access during development. (Make sure to secure these rules in production!)
   ```json
   service cloud.firestore {
     match /databases/{database}/documents {
       match /{document=**} {
         allow read, write: if true;  // Adjust rules for production
       }
     }
   }
   ```
5. Create a `blogs` collection and add some sample blog documents with the following structure:
   ```json
   {
     "title": "Blog Title",
     "content": "This is the content of the blog post.",
     "imageUrl": "https://example.com/image.jpg",
     "createdAt": "2024-10-01T16:52:44.855Z",
     "author": "Author Name"
   }
   ```
6. Obtain your Firebase configuration details from the project settings and add them to a `.env.local` file in your project root:
   ```plaintext
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_auth_domain
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_storage_bucket
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_messaging_sender_id
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
   ```
